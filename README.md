# ARChimEd - MolSym (Augmented Reality  for Chimie and Education â€“ Molecular Symmetry)

**ARChimEd - MolSym** is a cutting-edge mixed-reality educational application developed for the Meta Quest platform. It enables students, educators, and researchers to interactively explore **molecular symmetry** in three dimensions. Through immersive visuals, AI guidance, and gamified modules, users can deepen their understanding of symmetry operations and point groups.

## ðŸŽ“ Modules Overview

### ðŸ“˜ Learning Module

An interactive 3D course introducing the core concepts of molecular symmetry. Explore real molecular models and visualize the effects of symmetry operations such as rotations, reflections, and inversions.

### ðŸ§ª Training Module

Select from a curated library of 100+ molecules spanning all major point groups. Practice identifying symmetry elements by interacting with the molecule. Feedback and hints help guide learning.

### ðŸ§  Testing Module

Evaluate your understanding by attempting to identify the symmetry elements and point group of unknown molecules. Scores and achievements foster motivation and gamify the experience.
